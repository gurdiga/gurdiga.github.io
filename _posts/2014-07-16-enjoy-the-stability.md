It’ll take some time for the peace and comfort to become stability. I
think it’s OK to lean on it for a while and enjoy its comfort. Even if
it may feel like a plateau sometimes, that is fine: that stability is
the very thing that will let your innate curiosity overcome the fears
accumulated along the time and drive you towards exploration. The
exploration in turn, will help you find what makes you happy.

Happiness doesn’t have to be The One Thing™. Many small happy moments
make for a happy day. Many small happy days make for a happy month. Many
small happy months…

Those small happy moments generate inspiration, rise you a just a bit
higher, and which gives more and more clarity about the next place you
want to go.

Enjoy.
