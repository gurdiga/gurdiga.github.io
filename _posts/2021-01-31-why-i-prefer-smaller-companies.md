Here is a small post about working with small companies.

In my work as a software engineer, I prefer working with small companies. And because our relationship is centered around work, one of the bigger reasons is that it’s much easier to understand what are the pains, the priorities, it’s easier to understand if I can do what they need.

Another thing that I value in my work that goes hand-in-hand with the previous, is to have direct, or as close to direct as possible, communication with the stakeholder: with the business owner or the person that is directly interested in the prosperity of the business. A good communication channel makes it easier to better understand the business needs, and propose and negotiate options for fulfilling them. It’s also easier to communicate my needs and make sure I’m heard.

On the other side of the coin, the lack of good communication can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpreted priorities, and finally, to me, it may also be a sign that it’s time to look for something else. If a company grows and somehow manages to maintain that kind of culture and communication, that’s wonderful.

The thing that I can remember everyone’s name is good too. And the close human interactions that lead to good relationships can support growing a really enjoyable and fruitful collaboration.
