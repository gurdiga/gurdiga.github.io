I have recently shared a link to the one of the recent episodes of “Late
Nights with Trav and Los” podcast: “Why You Should Be A Publisher.” I’m
mentioning this because I find writing is a very interesting subject in
how it affects how I understand things, and how I see and understand
myself.

Trav and Los talk about the benefits of writing and how they think it
should be done. They set pretty high standards and this intimidated me
at first, but then I realized something.

I can tell that the way I write here now is far from what they set as a
goal, but I also know that I have consciously started this way, and I
have made peace with it. Even as unpolished and as unstructured as it is
now, I already see its effects and this is enough to keep me going
forward, one little step at a time.

There is certainly a lot of brilliant, very clear, very focused, and
well-rounded writing. But I think that having beginner- and
intermediate-level writing like this here is useful too because it
serves as middle steps on a ladder: without them it’d be too
intimidating for someone to begin. And I want to be an example of
someone who starts small and humble and seek to improve.
