I just finished reading “On Writing Well” by William Zinsser. I enjoyed
most of it. I’ve skipped the chapter on sports writing because sports is
not a subject I find particularly interesting (but I’m reading it now).
I feel a bit disoriented now: I’ve read a lot of good advice from a such
master, and I can’t say that I know the precise next steps to improve my
writing. I think I should have took notes.

Here I will try to write down a few things that I still have fresh in
mind and ones that I think I understand enough to follow.

* Write about things that you find interesting. Your reader will feel
	your joy.
* Be yourself, write in your natural tone—this will become your style.
* Keep an eye on the clichés expressions and use them sparingly.
* Don’t think too much about what your readers might say. It’s good to
	consider your audience but you should bend yourself too much only to
	fit them.  One thing that I found interesting is that how his advice
	to keep the words and phrases small and clear applies to programming
	too. I think this is one of those basic universal truths that apply in
	many contexts.

I guess one thing that I should do is to do more of it. I have times
when I feel inspired. I think I should watch for those and take notes.
